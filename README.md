# recipro
Simply place requests for errand services within the neighbourhood to connect with those willing to help!
Recipro is a mobile application focused on the concept of reciprocity and enhancing the connectivity within communities to improve social capital through a platform highlighting opportunities for acts of kindness in neighbourhoods.

#How it works
Recipro allows users to request for services and requires acts of kindness in return, which unlocks and earns brownie points
Receiving an act of kindness deducts brownie points. There are brownie point incentives to encourage the reciprocation of acts of kindness.
Once there is reciprocation, the pair become friends. Being friends enables you to see their requests more frequently, and allows you to take on more long-term, high-commitment tasks.
