# Recipro
Recipro is a mobile app that consolidates requests for aid in oneâ€™s community and empowers community members to likewise submit requests. This enables neighbours to practice and receive random acts of kindness, fostering a sense of belonging and connectivity in the community. Using the evidence-based principle of reciprocity, which describes the human tendency to respond to good acts with comparable generosity, Recipro connects people living within a 15km radius. From picking up groceries for a family nearby to walking the dog of a local teacher, communities become more tight-knit and resilient with Recipro. 


# How it works
Simply place requests for errand services within the neighbourhood to connect with those willing to help!
Recipro allows users to request for services and requires acts of kindness in return, which unlocks and earns Recipoints.
Receiving an act of kindness deducts Recipoints. There are point incentives to encourage the reciprocation of acts of kindness.
Once there is reciprocation, the pair become friends. Being friends enables you to see their requests more frequently, and allows you to take on more long-term, high-commitment tasks.
